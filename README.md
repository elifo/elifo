## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is [Elif Oral](https://elifo.github.io). I'm a scientist working on geohazard problems as a postdoctoral researcher at [Caltech](https://www.caltech.edu).

Here I share the numerical tools that I developed and/or contributed to, mostly applicable to advanced earthquake source mechanics, wave propagation, and geotechnical earthquake engineering. The Earth is evolving as well as my research activities and interests. So thanks for looking and stay tuned for open science ++
