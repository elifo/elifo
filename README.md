## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is [Elif Oral](https://elifo.github.io). I'm a scientist working on geohazard problems as a postdoctoral researcher at [Caltech](https://www.caltech.edu).

Here I share the numerical tools that I developed and/or contributed to, mostly relevant to earthquake source mechanics, wave propagation, and geotechnical earthquake engineering, and observational seismology. 

My favorite language is Python, so that the majority of my scripts for data analysis is of python libraries, class files, and Jupyter notebooks. The softwares for large-scale problems are hybrid with the core parts written once upon a time in Fortran, and the relatively new parts that adopt the spirit of its time and conditions, such as CUDA for GPU use in high performance computing.

The Earth is evolving as well as my research activities and interests. Thanks for looking, and stay tuned for more open science ++
